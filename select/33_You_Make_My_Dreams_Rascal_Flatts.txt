What I want you've got
And it might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Then you pull them all together
And how I can't explain, oh yeah

Well, well you
You make my dreams come true
Well, well, well you, oh yeah
You make my dreams come true

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same, oh yeah

Well, well you, oh yeah
You make my dreams come true
Well, well you, oh yeah
You make my dreams come true
(Listen to this)

I'm down on my daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know

Yeah, yeah
You make my dreams come true
Well, well you
You make my dreams come true
Yes you do

I've been waitin', ooh yeah
You make my dreams come true
I've been waitin'
You make my dreams come true
I've been waitin' for, waitin' for, waitin' for
Waitin' for...
You make my dreams come true
