- Sound Round -

I'm young in my camper van
The world feels old and new
I fear the future man
As I take in the view
Don't know where to head now
I give up? Go back?
My friends are all dead now
Or stifled in the sack

Sound round, feel the ground
Feel the pulse that we have found
Breathe in, feel the spin
Where's the dream that we were in?
Sound round, feel the ground
Feel the pulse that we have found

Sound round, feel the ground
Feel the pulse that we have found
Breathe in, feel the spin
Where's the dream that we were in?
Sound round, feel the ground
Feel the pulse that we have found

I'm young in my camper van
The world feels old and new
I fear the future man
As I take in the view

- Pick Up the Peace -

Now I'm in the ether
Look down at time
I see three children
Prepare to walk the line

I see them older
When life is done
I was a loser
At the game they won

Come on let's try
To pick up the peace
You and I
On our hands and knees
Come on let's try
To pick up, pick up the peace

Come on let's try
To touch the Fleece
You and I
On our hands and knees
Come on let's try
To pick up, pick up the peace

How do old people forget
That the wars we've seen
Are 'bout me longing for you
You longing for me?

- Endless Wire -

We found this pile of paper
Written by that ether man
He hatched a mad old caper
He had a mad old plan

He'd turn us into music
He'd show us to our portals
He gathered wire and angels
To entertain immortals

Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless, endless
Endless, endless wire

Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire

- We Got a Hit -

We got our folks together
We broke down barriers
We found a dream to dream
We were the carriers

We got rich and famous
Papers at our door
We talked a load of crap
They wanted more

We got a hit (Good news, we got a hit)
We got a hit (Good news, we got a hit)
We got a hit (Good news, we got a hit)
We got a hit (Good news, we-)
We got a hit
We got a hit
We got a hit
We got a hit

We got our folks together
We broke down barriers
We found a dream to dream
We were the carriers
We were the carriers

We got a hit (Good news, we got a hit)
We got a hit (Good news, we-)

- They Made My Dream Come True -

People died where I performed
People cried when Glass deformed
Shots rang out as the singer yawned
The band played on until the dawn

Lies and drunks and drugs and fools
Tricks and stunts disguise the tools
Was the victim dead, was there blood in pools
Was this not part of show-biz rules?

They made my dream come true
They made my dream come true
They made my dream come true
