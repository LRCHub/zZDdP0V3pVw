I'll keep on dreaming
Until my dreams come true

Until these arms of mine
Surround you all the time
I'll keep on dreaming
Until my dreams come true

Until your heart can see
What burns inside of me
I'll keep on dreaming
Until my dreams come true

Every day I cry a lonely tear
A tear of love
Especially just for you

Until my fantasy becomes reality
I'll keep on dreaming
Until my dreams come true

Every day I cry a lonely tear
A tear of love
Especially just for you

Until my fantasy becomes reality
I'll keep on dreaming
Until my dreams come true
