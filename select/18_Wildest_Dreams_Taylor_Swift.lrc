[00:13.18] He said, "Let's get out of this town
[00:16.59] Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
[00:20.00] I thought Heaven can't help me now
[00:23.30] Nothing lasts forever
[00:25.76] But this is gonna take me down
[00:40.76] 
[00:27.94] He's so tall and handsome as hell
[00:31.17] He's so bad, but he does it so well
[00:34.42] I can see the end as it begins
[00:37.85] My one condition is
[00:47.35] 
[00:41.25] Say you'll remember me
[00:43.78] Standing in a nice dress
[00:45.48] Staring at the sunset, babe
[00:48.17] Red lips and rosy cheeks
[00:50.67] Say you'll see me again
[00:52.57] Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
[01:01.92] Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
[01:14.42] 
[01:11.51] I said, "No one has to know what we do"
[01:14.56] His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
[01:18.75] And his voice is a familiar sound
[01:21.78] Nothing lasts forever
[01:23.95] But this is getting good now
[01:37.95] 
[01:26.20] He's so tall and handsome as hell
[01:29.43] He's so bad, but he does it so well
[01:32.88] And when we've had our very last kiss
[01:36.03] My last request is
[01:45.03] 
[01:39.48] Say you'll remember me
[01:42.15] Standing in a nice dress
[01:43.73] Staring at the sunset, babe
[01:46.58] Red lips and rosy cheeks
[01:48.97] Say you'll see me again
[01:50.76] Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha)
[02:00.26] Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
[02:12.76] 
[02:06.86] You'll see me in hindsight
[02:08.76] Tangled up with you all night
[02:10.47] Burning it down
[02:13.82] Someday when you leave me
[02:15.69] I bet these memories
[02:17.44] Follow you around
[02:25.94] 
[02:20.46] You'll see me in hindsight
[02:22.44] Tangled up with you all night
[02:24.19] Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)
[02:27.43] Someday when you leave me
[02:29.33] I bet these memories
[02:31.04] Follow (follow) you (you) around (follow you around)
[02:57.04] 
[02:37.71] Say you'll remember me
[02:40.68] Standing in a nice dress
[02:42.28] Staring at the sunset, babe
[02:44.82] Red lips and rosy cheeks
[02:47.34] Say you'll see me again
[02:49.13] Even if it's just pretend
[03:01.63] 
[02:53.22] Say you'll remember me
[02:55.89] Standing in a nice dress
[02:57.51] Staring at the sunset, babe
[03:00.24] Red lips and rosy cheeks
[03:02.78] Say you'll see me again
[03:04.46] Even if it's just (pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah)
[03:13.03] In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
[03:18.32] Even if it's just stayed in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
[03:26.78] In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
