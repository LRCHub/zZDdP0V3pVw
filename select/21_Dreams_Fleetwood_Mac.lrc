[00:11.77] Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
[00:23.18] Well, who am I to keep you down?
[00:30.43] It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
[00:39.63] But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
[01:05.63] 
[00:46.08] Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
[00:49.26] In the stillness of remembering what you had
[00:54.72] And what you lost
[01:00.47] And what you had
[01:04.22] And what you lost
[01:12.72] 
[01:09.77] Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
[01:17.60] Players only love you when they're playing
[01:25.77] Say, women, they will come and they will go
[01:33.44] When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
[01:39.26] You'll know
[01:44.76] 
[01:59.76] Now here I go again, I see the crystal vision
[02:07.41] I keep my visions to myself
[02:15.50] But it's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams, and
[02:22.44] Have you any dreams you'd like to sell, dreams of loneliness?
[02:52.94] 
[02:31.03] Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
[02:34.68] In the stillness of remembering what you had
[02:38.12] And what you lost
[02:41.84] And what you had
[02:49.14] Ooh, what you lost
[02:58.14] 
[02:54.44] Thunder only happens when it's raining
[02:59.29] Players only love you when they're playing
[03:09.99] Women, they will come and they will go
[03:17.30] When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
[03:38.80] 
[03:26.56] Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
[03:31.26] Players only love you when they're playing
[03:35.53] Say, women, they will come and they will go
[03:47.54] When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
[04:09.04] 
[04:06.54] You'll know
[04:07.02] You will know
[04:07.98] Oh-oh-oh, you'll know
